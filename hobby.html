  <h1>Ultimate</h1>

  <h3>I started playing ultimate a little bit in high school. At the time i didn't know that there was a whole community that takes it as seriously as i do now. It started out as a hobby but turned out to be something that i love the most. </h3>

  <ul>
    <li>At Luther we have three different teams. A men's A team (LUFDA), a men's B team (Pound) and a women's team (Freya)</li>
    <li>I ended up trying out for LUFDA my freshmen year and made the team!</li>  
    <li>Not many people know what ultimate is or how it is played so I usually just say it's soccer but with a disc</li>
      <ol> The main rules are:
        <li>You must maintain a pivot foot while you are in control of the disc.</li>
      </ol>
