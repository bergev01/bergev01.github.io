  <h1>Ultimate</h1> 
  </center>
  <h3>I started playing ultimate a little bit in high school. At the time I didn't know that there was a whole community that takes it as seriously as I do now. It started out as a hobby but turned out to be something that I love the most. </h3>

  <ul>
    <li>At Luther we have three different teams. A men's A team (LUFDA), a men's B team (Pound) and a women's team (Freya)</li>
    <li>I ended up trying out for LUFDA my freshmen year and made the team!</li>  
    <li>Not many people know what ultimate is or how it is played so I usually just tell them that it's soccer but with a disc.</li>
      <ol> The main rules are:
        <li>You must maintain a pivot foot while you are in control of the disc.</li>
        <li>The disc may be passed in any direction but as soon as another player catches it he/she must come to a stop as quickly as possible.</li>
      <li>A point is scored when a player catches the disc in the designated endzone.</li>
      <li>The disc changes possession upon an incomplete or intercepted throw.</li>
      <li>Perhaps my favorite part about ultimate is that there are no referees. This means that the entire game is self officiated which really enhances a sense of community and a spirit of the game.</li>
